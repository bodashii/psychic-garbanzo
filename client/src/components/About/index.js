        <h3>Hello World!</h3>
        <p>
          An avid gamer from my first console. The Super Nintendo entertainment
          System for those curious. I took up programming early around the age
          of 10. Even though some concepts were hard to understand at an early
          age. The accomplishment and challenge of telling a computer how and
          what to do was refreshing since its still a fairly new field. After
          some exposure to computer science and video game design I wanted to
          pursue the tech field. I took off for college but sadly it wasn't in
          my cards to attend UTSA at that time. You know life and all that. Well
          here I am ten years later. With my fullstack developer certificate and
          I'm ready for new challenges and to further my own education and
          skills.
