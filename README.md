# psychic-garbanzo // my portfolio
This is my personal portfolio page.

## Description
A place to host my portfolio projects for others to see. Also a great way 
to connect with me as a landing page.

### Features
This was built with react and hosted on heroku. React build was hosted
on github pages.

### Problems
Even though I'm able to see everything locally. The build isn't properly showing.
